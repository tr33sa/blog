title: About

I'm an outdoor enthusiast who studies Computer Science at Queens College in New York City.

Originally from Queens, I attended Louisiana State Univeristy from September 2010 to June 2014 where I studied <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland>Wetland</a> Ecology. A MATLAB class I took while there is what got me interested in programming. Despite starting my career as wetland ecologist in New York, in 2016 I followed by gut and returned to school for Computer Science.

In addition to my current studies, I'm an Adjunct Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Queens College teaching the basics of C++.
